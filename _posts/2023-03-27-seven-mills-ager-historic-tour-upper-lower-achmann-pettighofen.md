# The seven mills of Ager: A historic tour of Upper and Lower Achmann and Pettighofen

The River Ager in Upper Austria was once a thriving centre of milling activity. Along a short two-kilometre stretch of the river in the towns of Upper and Lower Achmann and Pettighofen, seven mills supplied flour and bread not only to the local population but also to neighbouring villages. Let's take a tour of these historic mills, starting with the "Mühle in der Au" or "Papiermühle" in Unterachmann.

## Mühle in der Au or Papiermühle

Located in the lower part of the Upper Ager in Unterachmann, the Mühle in der Au was originally a "hadern" mill, producing paper from textile scraps. The Peyr family owned the mill from 1690 to 1877, when Anton Peyr, the first mayor of Seewalchen, closed the mill and sold the property. Emil Hamburger bought the Aumühle in 1894 and in 1896 established the second paper mill on the Ager, the Pettighofen paper factory.

## Fellingermühle

Opposite the Rabler shop was the Fellingermühle, which ceased operations before 1894. The building initially housed workers from the paper mill, but was later converted into flats. However, it was demolished in April 2007 and replaced by a residential complex in 2017. Prior to its development, the green space was a public recreational area, mainly used for swimming.

## Kleinmühle

On the Seewalchen side of the Ager River stood the Kleinmühle (Pettighofen 14), which was in operation until the 1960s. After the owner, Rudolf Stallinger, retired, he sold the property in 1962 to another Rudolf Stallinger, known as Birmüller. The house is now a private residence.

## Birmühle or Pichlmühle

The Birmühle or Pichlmühle (Pettighofen 15) dates back to 1632 and was owned by the Stallinger family in the 19th century. It was the last of the seven mills to close in 1983. The former mill building now houses a small hydroelectric power station harnessing the power of a tributary of the River Ager.

## Steinmühle or Wengermühle

The most interesting of the seven mills is the Steinmühle (Wengermühle), which was first mentioned in a document in 1437. Duke Albrecht V, who reigned as Emperor Albrecht II of Germany from 1437 to 1439, donated the mill to the Kammer estate in Schörfling. In 1480 Emperor Friedrich III sold the hereditary rights to the mill. Wolfgang von Polheim, who held the Attergau lordship in pledge from 1499, refused to recognise this sale and caused discontent among the subjects concerned, who complained to the sovereign. In 1512 the deed of the Steinmühle was confirmed with the following text:

"Emperor Friedrich granted Hannsen Mullner am Stain the hereditary right for his wife and children".

These seven mills were crucial to the economic and social development of the region. Although most have since ceased to operate, their legacy lives on in the history and architecture of the area.
